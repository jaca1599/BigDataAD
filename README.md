# Description

This project explores the role of mitochondrial-related genes, particularly **TOMM40** and **APOE**, in the development of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Multiple data types were integrated, including:

- Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
- Transcriptomics
- Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks
- MRI imaging data

The goal was to identify molecular markers and brain regions affected in AD, and to build a model to predict AD risk based on MRI features.
